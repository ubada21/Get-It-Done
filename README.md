# Get-It-Done

### A Simple Todo List Application. 


This application is a simple implementation of a todo list. It is geared towards people who are looking for a simple todo list application, but is also for people who are not the best at managing their time and need a reminder to help them get stuff done and stay organized.

This application will allow users to :

- Add and remove tasks from a todo list.
- View their finished and unfinished tasks

This project is important to me because I am not great at managing my time. I wanted to build something that would help me better manage my time and finish tasks that I would usually forget about.


### User Stories

- As a user, I want to be able to add new tasks to the todo list.
- As a user, I want to be able to mark a task as completed.
- As a user, I want to be able to remove a task from the todo list.
- As a user, I want to be able to see the number of complete and incomplete tasks.
- As a user, I want to be able to see all my tasks.
- As a user, I want to be able to see all my completed tasks.
- As a user, I want to be able to see all my incomplete tasks.
- As a user, I want to be able to save my todo list to a file.
- As a user, I want to be able to load my todo list from a save file.


### Phase 4: Task 2
Initially, when the program runs, the EventLog is empty, because we do not add, remove or complete any tasks,

But if we run a demo of adding, removing and completing tasks, the EventLog output looks like this:


Wed Nov 24 22:56:19 PST 2021

Task has been added to the TodoList

Wed Nov 24 22:56:20 PST 2021

Task has been added to the TodoList

Wed Nov 24 22:56:21 PST 2021

Task has been added to the TodoList

Wed Nov 24 22:56:23 PST 2021

Task has been completed

Wed Nov 24 22:56:26 PST 2021

Wed Nov 24 22:56:30 PST 2021
