### A Simple Todo List Application. 


This application is a simple implementation of a todo list. It is geared towards people who are looking for a simple todo list application, but is also for people who are not the best at managing their time and need a reminder to help them get stuff done and stay organized.

This application will allow users to :

- Add and remove tasks from a todo list.
- View their finished and unfinished tasks

This project is important to me because I am not great at managing my time. I wanted to build something that would help me better manage my time and finish tasks that I would usually forget about.


### User Stories

- As a user, I want to be able to remove a task form the todo list.
